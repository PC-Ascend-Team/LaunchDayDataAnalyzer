# LaunchDayDataAnalyzer
This is a repo for programmatically graphing the launch day data testing out javascript, php, and C++ as options for languages to use. 

This turned out to be useless, as the solutions used were microsoft excel for standard data graphing over time by converting the text log file to a csv file. The other solution was using MATLAB for simulation of the roll, pith, and yaw flight data.


This repo was only developed up to the point that the C++ pathway now has a crude graphing method that can break easily. The other language based ones are not developed.
